# The Application GUI for representing the whole system 

Flutter desktop application for representing the whole system.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

What is Flutter and how it works as a framework for building desktop apps:

- [Flutter: The official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
- [Desktop with flutter: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/multi-platform/desktop)

# Run the application in debug mode:

Just open 'application' directory and run 'flutter create .' in the terminal to configure the application with the write config files

## Tip:

If windows binaries didn't work for some reason (may be you are using this code in 2030 or some thing) just delete the 'windows' directory and the visual studio will place build artifacts here when you build this app.
